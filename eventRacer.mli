(** {1 Access to raw EventRacer log files} *)
(** This module allows access to the raw contents of EventRacer log files,
    decoded only to the point where the enumerations have been resolved,
    strings instantiated and basic data structures turned to their OCaml
    equivalent.
    
    It is recommended to use the functionality in [CleanLog] instead.
